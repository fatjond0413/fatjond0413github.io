### Learning about CLI(Command Line Interface)

**CLI** (Command Line Interface) are text based commands that input files and folders which you can edit like moving them, changing names, etc.
When first learning cli I was very confused about it as it had nothing to do with html and was much more worried for the future when the seniors said this was easy.
I did not understand the lessons or the work at all starting out and had 6 missing assiments related to CLI. I could not even understand **pwd** or **mkdir**. After a while  i begain to understand the basics like **pwd**, **mkdir**, **mv**, and **ls**. But I still did not know how to set up ide even after ewatching the vidoe and reading the intrustions twice. I had to go to tutoring and get my teacher ***Mr.muller*** to set it up for me. After studing for hours during winter break I  got a good understanding of cli.

### Takeaways from cli and how I will learn *future lessons*.

 Some takeaways I got from ***cli*** and things I should do in the future will me listed below

* Spend two to three hours every two days reviewing sep10 and the current lesson ***Mr Muller*** is teaching.

* I should go to tutoring wenever I get the chance.

* [*I also decided to ad a link to a cli guide I found on the internet.*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ds8900/9.0.2?topic=interface-cli-commands)
