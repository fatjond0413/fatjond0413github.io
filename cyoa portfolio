<h1>CYOA Portfolio</h1>

<h2>The plan</h2>

<p>Me and my partners planed to make a adventure were we wake up in a alternate universe were we either are aliens, or humans in an alien world. I took most direction in the human part were my parters did one file and they took the alien route.</p>

<h2>Creating the Adventure</h2>

<p>We did out route I wrote the text and made the files on my IDE and helped my group when one of my parters was absent. I also helped my group in showing them how to make links. Then we just did our thinks, nothing to diffrent from the restaurant assignment</p>

<h2>Looking back</h2>

<p>I don't completly understand why Mr.Mueller gave this asignment, but I did relearn how use links better and got more experince working with people through the laptop like the restaurant assignment with Nancy.</p>

<h2>The Challanges</h2>

<p>What was tough about this project was the links and the amount of time it took along with doing extra files because my partner was absent. Also remebering the code and trying my absoulte hardest not to forget.</p>
