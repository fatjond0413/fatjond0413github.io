            <p><p>Me and my partners planed to make a adventure were we wake up in a alternate universe were we either are aliens, or humans in an alien world. I took most direction in the human part or the dark blue part were my parters did one file and they took the alien route. In the human route I made it so that you have multiple choices at time and singile choices at time that lead to diffrent endings like you dieing from a 70 floor fall or geting experimented on by alien doctors. Or mabye you Alien Dad thnks your sick, and resarts were you begin when you wake up from your bed.I had the entire story set.</p>

<h2>Creating the Adventure</h2>

<p>We did out route I wrote the text and made the files on my IDE and helped my group when one of my parters was absent. I also helped my group in showing them how to make links. Then we just did our thinks, nothing to diffrent from the restaurant assignment. But abit easier if I am being honest. Here is the <a herf="./projects/CYOA"></a>
</p>

<h2>Looking back</h2>

<p>I don't completly understand why Mr.Mueller gave this asignment, but I did relearn how use links better and got more experince working with people through the laptop like the restaurant assignment with Nancy.</p>

<h2>The Challanges</h2>

<p>What was tough about this project was the links and the amount of time it took along with doing extra files because my partner was absent. Also remebering the code and trying my absoulte hardest not to forget. If I am being honest the portfolio was harder trying to get all the requirements</p>

<h2>Upnext</h2>

<p>Upnext will review the project to see if I can imporove upone anything for the next along with trying establish better ways to work wuth my peers. It is always better to improve and i might need it depending upon my grade I recive.</p>
